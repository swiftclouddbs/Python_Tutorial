<h1>Intention here is to introduce REST API to VMWare experts.</h1> <br>

   The best way to learn Python, REST and AI code generating capabilities
   is to paste this script into ChatGPT after typing the question:  what does
   this code do and how do I use it?  
   The AI will explain it to you and tell you how to setup a Python environment
   so you can run this script on your vCenter.<br><br>

   You will need to install Python and an IDE to use the code.  IDLE is an
   excellent IDE and often installs with Python.<br><br>

   The code makes a REST call to vCenter and gets the vmids, machine names and
   network card type and prints them to a csv.  The functionality does not
   compete with Aria.  REST allows VMWare to connect to complimentary prodcuts
   like Team Dynamix Asset Managers.  Power users can write programs that
   interface with Cisco, Oracle and other products.  <br><br>

   Output goes to a csv file and contains three columns:  vm_id,vm_name,nic_type<br>
   
   This will give you tools and some insight into using Python, REST and VMWare!!
