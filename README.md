<h1>Intention here is to introduce REST API to VMWare experts.</h1> <br>

#   The best way to learn Python, REST and AI code generating capabilities<br>
#   is to paste this script into ChatGPT after typing the question:  what does<br>
#   this code do and how do I use it?  <br>
#   The AI will explain it to you and tell you how to setup a Python environment<br>
#   so you can run this script on your vCenter.<br><br>
#
#   You will need to install Python and an IDE to use the code.  IDLE is an<br>
#   excellent IDE and often installs with Python.<br><br>
#
#   The code makes a REST call to vCenter and gets the vmids, machine names and<br>
#   network card type and prints them to a csv.  The functionality does not <br>
#   compete with Aria.  REST allows VMWare to connect to complimentary prodcuts<br>
#   like Team Dynamix Asset Managers.  Power users can write programs that<br>
#   interface with Cisco, Oracle and other products.  <br><br>
#
#   Output goes to a csv file and contains three columns:  vm_id,vm_name,nic_type<br>
#   
#   This will give you tools and some insight into using Python, REST and VMWare!!
